# Warehouse Impact Tracker - Development Context

## Project Overview
Recreating warehouse location and impact dataset using only public, unlicensed sources to remain legally compliant while providing community-focused warehouse monitoring.

## Legal Compliance Framework
- ✅ Using public data sources (county permits, CEQA, CARB)
- ✅ Building independent code and models from scratch
- ✅ No copying of WAREHOUSE CITY's proprietary data or code
- ✅ Clear data provenance tracking

## Data Source Inventory

### Phase 1: Public Data Sources (Current)
- **Riverside County**: Permit databases, planning records
- **San Bernardino County**: Development applications, zoning data  
- **CEQA Database**: Environmental impact documents
- **CARB**: Air quality and emissions data
- **State Agencies**: Business registrations, facility permits

### Data Collection Architecture
- Modular service-based approach for each data source
- Automated reliability testing and coverage assessment
- Clear documentation of assumptions and mappings
- Error handling and data validation built-in

## Development Log

### Phase 1: Public Data Source Research & Documentation (Current)
- **Created**: `DEVELOPMENT_CONTEXT.md` - Project tracking and documentation
- **Created**: `src/services/publicDataSources.ts` - Comprehensive catalog of 11 public data sources
  - Riverside County: Building permits, planning records, GIS data
  - San Bernardino County: Building permits, planning records  
  - California State: CEQA database, CARB emissions, Cal Fire hazards
  - Federal: EPA facilities, DOT freight data
  - Includes testing utilities and filtering functions
- **Created**: `src/components/PublicDataResearch.tsx` - Research interface component
  - Interactive data source catalog with testing capabilities
  - Real-time accessibility testing for all sources
  - Reliability scoring and coverage analysis
  - Legal compliance documentation

### Key Assumptions & Mappings
- **Inland Empire Definition**: Primarily Riverside & San Bernardino Counties
- **Warehouse Classification**: Includes distribution centers, fulfillment centers, logistics hubs >50,000 sq ft
- **Status Classifications**: Maps to existing warehouse.ts types (upcoming, in-construction, operating, dormant)
- **Data Update Frequencies**: Ranges from real-time (APIs) to annually (compliance reports)

### Next Steps
- Add route to App.tsx for `/public-data-research`
- Phase 2: Build data collection services for high-priority sources
- Focus on Riverside County GIS API (highest reliability) and CEQA database first
